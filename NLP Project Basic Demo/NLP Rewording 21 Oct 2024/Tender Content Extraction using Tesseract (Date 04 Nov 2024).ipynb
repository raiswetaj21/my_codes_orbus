      "should also support vertical and horizontal scalability so that depending on changing\n",
      "requirements from time to time, the system may be scaled upwards. There must not be any\n",

      "Availability - Components of the architecture must provide redundancy and ensure that are no\n",

      "systems need to be configured to recover with minimum outage. The bidder shall make the\n",
      "provision for high availability for all the services of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interoperability - The system should have capability to take inputs from other third party\n",
      "systems as per situational requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security - The architecture must adopt an end-to-end security model that protects data and the\n",
      "infrastructure from malicious attacks. Using Firewalls and Intrusion detection systems such\n",
      "attacks should be controlled and well supported (and implemented) with the security policy.\n",
      "The virus and worm's attacks should be well defended with Gateway level Anti-virus system,\n",
